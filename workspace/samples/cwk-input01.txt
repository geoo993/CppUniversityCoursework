This long double number (1.18973e+4932) is the maximum floating number range of a long double. 
You can prove this by doing: std::numeric_limits< long double >::max() is 1.18973e+4932). 
Setting this on an integer will give you: -2147483648, 
which is the minimum limit value of a signed long integer. 
when set on other types like double or float will just give you: inf, which is the special value "positive infinity", 
a number that I can simply describe as very large.
